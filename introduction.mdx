## Getting Started
To get started, make sure you are using the correct `client_id` and `client_secret` for the environment you are using.

For staging, please access `api-staging.speccheckrx.com`, and for production, it is `api.speccheckrx.com`.

## Request Headers
For the [Create Order](/api-reference/endpoint/create_order) and [Get Options](/api-reference/endpoint/get_options) APIs, you will need to pass in `Authorization: bearer your_access_token`. `your_access_token` is what is returned in the [Get Token API](/api-reference/endpoint/get_token). Note that this expires after 24 hours, so best practice is to call the Get Token API before every call. 

You will also need to pass your `client_id` as such `Client-Id: your_client_id` in the headers.
